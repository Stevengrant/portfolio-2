    Modify the contents of the template to make it your own. The HTML elements may remain the same if you like, but the content should be adapted to reflect your personal details and skills.
    Apply the following changes, some of which were part of your prework for this course:
        Next to the header image, add your name and a short, 2-3 word title.
        In the Intro section, add a personal headline. This should be the same as or similar to your headline on your LinkedIn profile.
        In the Portfolio section, state what you are excited about in tech. Add links to projects and include placeholders for future 301 and 401 projects. If you would like, you can add links to sites such as LinkedIn and GitHub here, or social sites.
        In the About Me section, add your personal pitch and banner photo.
    Add you own color scheme and Google fonts.
    Change the content and images to reflect your personal preferences. If you are using online images, make sure they are licensed for free, commercial use. For example, Unsplash has a nice variety of free images.
    Update the list of social media icons with your links using icons for your favorite social media sites from IcoMoon or Font Awesome.
    Keep in mind that this template is just a starting point. It is yours to modify to reflect your personal online presence as a software developer so have fun and be creative!
